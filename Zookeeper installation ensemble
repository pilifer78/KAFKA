#### initLimit= is the amount of the time to allow followers to connect with a leader #####

X= ID number of the server, this must be an integer, but it does not need to be zero-based or sequential.
hostname=the hostname or IP address of the server
peerPort=The TCP port over which servers in the ensemble communicate with each other

In addition to the shared configuration file, each server must have a file in the dataDir directory with the name myid, this file must contain the ID number of the server, which must
